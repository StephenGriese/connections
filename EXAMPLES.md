# Example Connections Puzzles

## Example 1: Simple Pattern-Based

Words:
```
FIRE
FIRST
FIRM
FISH
BLUE
BLUR
BLURT
BLUSH
APPLE
APPLY
APPS
APRON
DOG
CAT
BIRD
RAT
```

This example has clear prefix patterns:
- FI**: FIRE, FIRST, FIRM, FISH
- BLU**: BLUE, BLUR, BLURT, BLUSH
- APP**: APPLE, APPLY, APPS, APRON
- Animals: DOG, CAT, BIRD, RAT

## Example 2: NYTimes-Style (More Complex)

A real NYTimes Connections puzzle might look like:
```
BASS
CLUB
DIAMOND
HEART
SPADE
SOLE
PERCH
TROUT
WOOD
IRON
DRIVER
PUTTER
ACE
KING
QUEEN
JACK
```

Actual groups:
- Card suits: CLUB, DIAMOND, HEART, SPADE
- Fish: BASS, SOLE, PERCH, TROUT
- Golf clubs: WOOD, IRON, DRIVER, PUTTER
- Face cards: ACE, KING, QUEEN, JACK

Note: This would be challenging for basic pattern matching and would benefit from semantic/category knowledge.
